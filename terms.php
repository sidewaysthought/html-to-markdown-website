        <p>You agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between you and

            Thought LLC as a result of this agreement or use of the Site. Sideways Thought LLC's performance of this
            agreement is subject to existing laws and legal process, and nothing contained in this agreement is in
            derogation of Sideways Thought LLC's right to comply with governmental, court and law enforcement requests
