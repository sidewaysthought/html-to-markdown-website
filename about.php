            converting HTML content into Markdown. Ideal for platforms like ChatGPT or GitHub, our tool is perfect for
            both tech-savvy individuals and those less familiar with HTML.</p>
        <h3>Features</h3>
        <p>The converter is intuitive and straightforward, offering features like CSS selector-based HTML filtering, and
            options to copy or download the Markdown output.</p>

        <h3>Technologies Used</h3>
        <p>This site is built with PHP and Bootstrap, a framework developed by (the company formally known as) Twitter.
            which helps ensure a responsive and mobile-first experience. The core functionality, converting HTML to
            Markdown, is made possible by <a href="https://github.com/mixmark-io/turndown">TurnDown</a>, a versatile
            JavaScript library which is &copy; 2017 by Dom Christie, and is released under the MIT license.</p>
